3. Open the command prompt.
4. Enter the command "java -jar {path}\projectstep4.jar" where {path} is the location of the jar file.
5. The program will start running, and you will need to enter the username and password to connect to your database.
6. The reports will be generated.
7. For the third report, user input is required, and it should be entered into the console.
